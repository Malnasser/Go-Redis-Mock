# redis-go

A simple Redis server implementation in Go. This is a mock example I built to learn about network programming and the Redis protocol.

## What it does

It's a basic Redis clone that handles a few commands:

- `PING` - returns PONG
- `ECHO` - echoes back what you send
- `SET` - stores a key-value pair with optional expiration (e.g., `SET key value EX 10` for 10 seconds)
- `GET` - retrieves a value by key (returns nil if expired)

## Running it

```bash
./redis_server
```

The server runs on port 6379 (standard Redis port).

## Testing

You can test it with `redis-cli` or netcat:

```bash
# Using redis-cli
redis-cli ping
redis-cli set mykey "hello"
redis-cli get mykey

# With expiration (expires in 5 seconds)
redis-cli set tempkey "temporary" PX 5
redis-cli get tempkey  # returns "temporary"
# Wait 5+ seconds...
redis-cli get tempkey  # returns (nil)

# Using netcat
echo -e '*1\r\n$4\r\nPING\r\n' | nc localhost 6379
```

## Notes

This is just a learning project - it implements the bare minimum of the Redis protocol to understand how it works. Don't use this in production! ðŸ˜„
